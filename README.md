Theorema
==============
A System for Mathematical Theory Exploration and Automated Theorem Proving
--------------

This repository serves for the development of the Theorema system, see
also http://www.risc.jku.at/research/theorema/software/.

Theorema is a Mathematica package implemented in the Mathematica programming
language. The repository contains an entire _Wolfram Workbench project_ for
system development, i.e. if you clone the repository into a fresh directory,
then the existing project can be imported into the Workbench's workspace from
that directory. The project contains a directory "Theorema", which is the base
directory of the Mathematica package itself making up the Theorema system.

This repository is the thing you need if you want to _contribute_ to system
development. If you only want to _use the system_, you are probably better
off if you download just the Theorema package from 
http://www.risc.jku.at/research/theorema/software/.
