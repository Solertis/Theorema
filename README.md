Theorema
==============
A System for Mathematical Theory Exploration and Automated Theorem Proving
--------------

Theorema was conceived and initiated around 1995 by Bruno Buchberger and
reflects his view of "doing mathematics". It is being developed under his
guidance by the Theorema Working Group at the Research Institute for Symbolic
Computation, Johannes Kepler University, Linz - Hagenberg, Austria.
Theorema 2.0 is a major re-launch mainly developed by Wolfgang Windsteiger.

This repository serves for the development of the Theorema system, see
also http://www.risc.jku.at/research/theorema/software/.

Theorema is a Mathematica package implemented in the Mathematica programming
language. The repository contains an entire _Wolfram Workbench project_ for
system development, i.e. if you clone the repository into a fresh directory,
then the existing project can be imported into the Workbench's workspace from
that directory. The project contains a directory "Theorema", which is the base
directory of the Mathematica package itself making up the Theorema system.

This repository is the thing you need if you want to _contribute_ to system
development. If you only want to _use the system_, you are probably better
off if you download just the Theorema package from 
http://www.risc.jku.at/research/theorema/software/.
